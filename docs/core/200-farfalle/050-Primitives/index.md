Primitives are either sets of Tokens (Styles) that represent a group of attributes or a reference to an asset. They are simple visual artifact used as elementary bricks to build other components.

Within Pasta they are stricly made of Choices and-or Assets (Icon Files, Fonts). Like all Components they are not allowed to embed Components of the same or a higher rank.
