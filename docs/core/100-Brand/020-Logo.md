# Logo

## Logotype

The Yummly logo is a custom script that conveys the personality of the brand. The  mark combines the two “m” characters, while the thick swashes of the “Y” give the word mark a friendly presence.

    <h3>Yum Button</h3>
    <p>The Yum word mark represents an extension of the brand. After you “Yum” a recipe it is saved to your collection. The Yum button is always orange until you “Yum” a recipe. It then switches to a white Yum’d button, signifying a saved recipe. Proper clearspace should always be applied with any use of the Yum Button. Use the width of the <strong>“m”</strong> for clear space.</p>
