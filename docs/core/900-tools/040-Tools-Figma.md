# Figma

In this section we address best practices regarding the developpement of Pasta inside Figma. Please refer to [Figma Help](https://help.figma.com/) for Figma usage, per se.

## Libraries Assets

Always use a properly named Figma Frame to host all your assets.




### Variants Ownership

Always attach owner to Variants (Components, Patterns, Primitives) inside Figma using the dedicated asset from the "Collaboration" section.

## Keep your files and canvases organized

In your canvas use the `Hero_Title` asset to name your section, and keep consistent vertcial and horizontal spaces between all your sections.
