- Make frequent choices efficient
   - Is component or variant used frequently?
   - Less clicks is more
- Always favor usability (over maintenance)
   - easy to use
   - designers should be aware what each component offers
   - make it hard to fo the wrong thing
- Take away visual decisions
   - Our answer: Design Tokens
- Handle breaking changes in advance
   - Figma usage: [watch video](https://youtu.be/3bBWYDvaONY?t=957)
- Bridge the gap
   - Help developers to navigate [to quickly get what they need](https://youtu.be/3bBWYDvaONY?t=1217)
